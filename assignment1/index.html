<h3>1</h3>
<h4> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
</h4>
<h5>The first thing that caught my attention was the 3d model entailing each of their projects within the centre of the landing page. The model was interactive, and redirected the user to each of the projects when clicked as well as rotated along with the position of the mouse cursor. </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>2</h3>
<h4> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
</h4>
<h5>
- hovered mouse around the landing page
<br>
- scrolled down the website to view different projects as prompted by the site
<br>
- hovered and clicked through the navigation bar on the side
<br>
- clicked into each project to read about the details 
<br>
- clicked around to interact with the small features the website offered 
</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>3</h3>
<h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
</h4>
<h5>I spent the most time engaging with the 'Omada' project section, which featured two small 3D interactive sections where the user was able to click and shoot a basketball into a hoop, and clicking to ‘kick’ a soccer ball into a goal to trigger a small confetti effect. It was an interesting add-in to increase the interactions between users and the website. </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>4</h3>
<h4>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
<h5>The most common action was using the mouse to hover and click around the page to interact with the different objects on the website. Because each project was separated into various sections, and buttons were used to redirect each page, clicking the left mouse button was essential in order for me to navigate around the webpage. </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>5</h3>
<h4> What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
<h5>From observation, the primary goal of the interactive project was to encourage designers to be a part of the ‘Luniverse’. Although there were descriptions to each of the applications they were working on, there was a lack of download links and in-app screenshots to inspire users to download their product. Instead, there were several conceptual images and links to their careers page and descriptions about their working mottos and environment, which created the impression that the purpose of the site is to give insight into the team behind Luni, and to motivate users to join them. </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>6</h3>
<h4> How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
</h4>
<h5>The purpose of Luni was to inspire users to join their team, which was evident as there was already a button to redirect users to their career’s page at the landing page, as well as at the end of their projects. </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>7</h3>
<h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
</h4>
<h5>While the site itself is intriguing, I don’t think that it could withhold a long-term interaction with the general public, unless only for job seekers who would regularly check if they have new positions in their team. Although they may release new projects over time and update it on the webpage, the Luni team lacks released products to build up reputation in the industry, which doesn’t help with drawing more people into joining their team.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>8</h3>
<h4>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
<h5>For the general public, the interactions on the pages are fun however it does not keep records or live leaderboards to encourage multiple revisits onto the site. But for designers and developers seeking a job, the Luni group seems to update their career page regularly, so these designers and developers could revisit the site for new opportunities. </h5>

<h3>9</h3>
<h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
</h4>
<h5>The colour palette and the details of the 3D models that Luni employed is quite lively and has a home-like aesthetic, which could be due to the fact that their products are closely related to our daily lives. There is also a hint of futurism, usage of three dimensional interactions and stylized characters to show their fun, and free spirited working environment. </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>10</h3>
<h4>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h4>
<h5>They used a warm and not contrasted colour palette so that when users browse the site, it won’t be harming the eyes. As well as the interactions that almost reminds me of small flash games, which can even entertain the general public, thus causing consumers to linger longer to browse the site.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>11</h3>
<h4>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h4>
<h5>The aesthetics and the small details of the 3D models in the website can bring a sense of familiarity and comfort. The transitions between each page can also be highly satisfying to the users.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>12</h3>
<h4>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h4>
<h5>I think it’s the page redirected within ‘Kitchen Lab’ that was a bit frustrating for me because it led to a full page of content without the ability to return to the previous page, but only to go to the home page by clicking on the ‘luni’ logo on the top left. It’s the extra step of having no choice but to jump back to the homepage, as well as the page not having continuity with the other projects(the others had a similar style whereas the Kitchen Lab page was significantly different).</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>13</h3>
<h4>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h4>
<h5>The responsiveness of the 3D models was incredibly satisfying, because it was highly sensitive to the position of the mouse cursor, and could respond almost immediately upon contact with the cursor. </h5>
