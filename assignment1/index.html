<h4> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?
</h4>
<h5>The first thing that caught my attention was the 3d model entailing each of their projects within the centre of the landing page. The model was interactive, and redirected the user to each of the projects when clicked as well as rotated along with the position of the mouse cursor. </h5>
<br>
<br>
<h3>2</h3>
<h4> Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.
</h4>
<br>
<br>
<h3>3</h3>
<h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
</h4>
<h5>I spent the most time engaging with the Omada project section, which featured two small 3D interactive sections where the user was able to click and shoot a basketball into a hoop, and clicking to ‘kick’ a soccer ball into a goal to trigger a small confetti effect with some coins.</h5>

<h3>4</h3>
<h4>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
<h5>The most common action was using the mouse to hover and click around the page to interact with the different objects on the website. Because each project was separated into various sections, and buttons were used to redirect each page, clicking the left mouse button was essential in order for me to navigate around the webpage. </h5>
